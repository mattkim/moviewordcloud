Bay has said that this film will kick off a second trilogy of Transformers movies - and I think he's serious. That means there will be (at least) two more of these things. God help us all. I sincerely enjoyed the Transformer who was literally branded by Oreo.â€ª The movie's crammed with useless nuts and bolts, the storytelling equivalent of a mechanic who lifts the hood of your car and says, That's everything, fix it yourself.Transfourmers, as I like to call it, is everything you could want in a big-budget tentpole, so long as what you want is sound and fury signifying nothing beyond a guarantee that more of the same is already on the way. The beginning and end of this film are too far apart. It could have been cut by an hour without missing anything important. It is just bloated with junk, including excessive product placement. Inflated, interminable and incoherent Can I make a citizen's arrest for assault with intent to bore to death? Big, dumb and fun. Transformers: Age Of Extinction provides action with zero tension. Michael Bay's latest exercise in excess is the biggest, longest, loudest, explodiest film ever made. The ploy Bay has used, unsuccessfully, is that as the story becomes more and more stupid, and the stupidity is jaw-dropping in its scope, the effects become bigger and bigger It's big, dumb and ugly, but you can also avoid it pretty readily if you want. Why are we here? What is the purpose of life on earth? And why are alien robots so hellbent on impersonating our automobiles?";
